# CAFE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTUM

I recently developed a Café Management System using Python to streamline day-to-day operations of a café. This project includes features like:

✅ Menu Management
✅ Order Processing
✅ Billing and Invoicing
✅ Inventory Tracking
✅ User Authentication (Admin & Staff)
✅ Clean Console UI / GUI (if applicable)

The system is designed for ease of use, scalability, and real-time performance — ideal for small to medium-sized cafés aiming to digitize their workflow.

Technologies used: Python, SQLite, OOP, Tkinter (if GUI), etc.
